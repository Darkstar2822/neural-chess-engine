```python
# Specialized populations with distinct strategies
populations = {
    "aggressive": AggressivePopulation(size=30),     # Tactical attackers
    "defensive": DefensivePopulation(size=30),       # Solid defenders
    "positional": PositionalPopulation(size=30),     # Strategic players

for generation in range(max_generations):
    # Inter-population tournaments
    fitness_matrix = cross_tournament(populations)
    
    # Evolve based on competitive success
    populations = evolve_populations(populations, fitness_matrix)
    
    # Test against Stockfish
    stockfish_results = benchmark_vs_stockfish(get_champions(populations))
```

### 🧬 Neuroevolution Engine
```python
# NEAT-inspired topology evolution
class NeuroevolutionEngine:
    def mutate_topology(self, genome):
        # Add nodes by splitting connections
        if random() < add_node_rate:
            self.add_node_mutation(genome)
        
        # Add new connections
        if random() < add_connection_rate:
            self.add_connection_mutation(genome)
        
        # Evolve activation functions
        if random() < activation_mutation_rate:
            self.mutate_activations(genome)
    
    def crossover_genomes(self, parent1, parent2):
        # Innovation-number-based crossover
        return self.align_and_cross(parent1, parent2)
```

### 📊 Graph Neural Networks
```python
# Chess positions as graphs
class ChessGNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Nodes: chess squares with piece features
        self.node_embed = nn.Linear(13, 64)  # 12 pieces + empty
        
        # Edges: spatial + attack relationships
        self.graph_conv = ChessGraphConv(64, 64, edge_features=4)
        
        # Chess-specific attention
        self.attention = ChessAttention(64)
    
    def forward(self, node_features, edge_index, edge_attr):
        # Graph convolution with chess-specific operations
        x = self.node_embed(node_features)
        x = self.graph_conv(x, edge_index, edge_attr)
        x = self.attention(x)  # Focus on critical squares
        
        return self.policy_head(x), self.value_head(x)
```

### 🧠 Memory-Augmented Networks
```python
# Experience-based learning
class MemoryAugmentedChessNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, memory_size=1000):
        # Differentiable memory bank
        self.memory = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(memory_size, 128))
        
        # Attention over memory
        self.memory_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(128, 8)
    
    def forward(self, position):
        # Query memory for similar positions
        query = self.encoder(position)
        memory_content, _ = self.memory_attention(query, self.memory, self.memory)
        
        # Combine position + memory
        enhanced = torch.cat([query, memory_content], dim=-1)
        return self.policy_head(enhanced), self.value_head(enhanced)
```

## 🎯 Training Strategies

### 🏆 Anti-Stockfish Training

2. **Counter-Strategy Evolution**: Evolve populations specifically to exploit weaknesses
3. **Style Specialization**: Different populations target different Stockfish aspects
4. **Adaptive Testing**: Continuous evaluation against multiple Stockfish levels

### 🧬 Population Specialization
```python
# Specialized individual creation
def create_aggressive_specialist():
    individual = SpecializedIndividual(
        playing_style=PlayingStyle.AGGRESSIVE,
        style_strength=1.2,  # Strong tactical bias
        anti_engine_training=["stockfish", "komodo"]
    )
    return individual

def create_defensive_specialist():
    individual = SpecializedIndividual(
        playing_style=PlayingStyle.DEFENSIVE, 
        style_strength=1.1,  # Solid positional bias
        anti_engine_training=["houdini", "leela"]
    )
    return individual
```

### 📈 Multi-Objective Evolution
